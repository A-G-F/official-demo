Page: Content Elements | Accordion
===========

# Content slider

The content slider does exactly, what its name says. Similar to the accordion the slider needs a wrapper start and stop. All elements placed between these wrapper elements represent the slided content.

The wrapper start element offers you some parameters to modify the slider:

1. Sliding interval: the time in milliseconds a slide is displayed until it is replaced by the next
one (1000 = 1s)
1. Transition speed: the speed of the transition from slide to slide in milliseconds (1000 = 1s)
1. Slide offset: setting a specific slide as the starting point, the counting starts at 0
1. Continous: Make the slider start all over when reaching the end

You can see the slider in action on the homepage.

To use it, jQuery or Mootools need to be enabled in the page layout and the corresponding j- or moo-template has to be added as well.
