# File elements

File elements create the possibility to make files available for download on your website. The element „Download“ allows you to make a single file downloadable. The element „Downloads“ has the same functions with the addition, that you can choose several files at once.
Before using the file element itself, you should upload all the files you want to provide on your website in the Contao file manager. After accomplishing that you can create the file element. The element allowes you to:

1. set the „source file“ by selecting the desired file in the file manager
2. enter a word or phase which replaces the file name as the name of the download
