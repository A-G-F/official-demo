# Media elements

Images, videos and other media are one of the most powerful contents available for a website. Images are faster to assess and have a stronger impact on the visitor compared to a simple text block. Therefore Contao allows you to integrate different kinds of media easily. When creating a media element, e.g. for an image, in the back end, you are able to:

1. select a media source where the image is uploaded from
2. a substitute text, which is shown, if the image can not be displayed
3. the height and width of the image, the distance of the image to the surrounding text
4. the destination website, if the image acts as a link
5. a subline for the image
6. the option to show the image in full resolution, when the visitor clicks on the image Some media can also be grouped in a gallery.
